### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm human species! Can you try me on that!?

Explosion from the bottom of a well
Thin walls, harsh winds
I tried to tap a deeper, brighter vein
But I'm back in old skin again
Pale stone
I am out of blood
Left in the chapel by a thousand other things I could've loved
But barely touched

We used to talk to God with acid on our tongues
We were divine when we were drunk
Before the world put out the fire and fed us crumbs

Chasing bended light
I went missing on the roads that wind through the corners of your eyes

Barbarians
Guard yourself with laughter, numb the meaning with the word
Barbarians
We tamper with a down machine but know it cannot work
Barbarians

We had such promise until we broke our promises
We had such promise until we broke our promises
We had such promise until we broke our promises
We had such promise until we broke our promises

Why can't it be the year 2000?
I want to live in the year 2000
When I was dumb enough to truly believe

Why can't it be the year 2000?
I want to live in the year 2000
When having nothing meant having everything

No one is taking my calls anymore
I can never get through
Acknowledge me, you motherfuckers
I am cold and I'm blue

You savages
Barbarians
